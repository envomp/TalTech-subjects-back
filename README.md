Getting Started
----
## Quick install and setup

##### Debian
run in terminal:
```
./frontend_local_install.sh
```
This script has been tested on Ubuntu 18.04 and 19.04
##### Other operating systems
Install Debian based operating system and read the guide above.
 
or 

Read the `frontend_local_install.sh` file and acquire inspiration 
for necessary steps from there.

## Manual setup

#### Local docker with postgres ####

You need latest of: Docker

```
git clone https://gitlab.cs.ttu.ee/envomp/iti0203-2019-project.git
cd iti0203-2019-project
docker-compose up -d
```

#### Local host machine with H2 ####
You need latest of: Java11

___
##### for Linux
```
./mvnw clean install
java -jar -Dspring.config.location=src/main/resources/application-dev.properties target/backend-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```


##### for Windows

```
mvnw.cmd clean install
java -jar -Dspring.config.location=src/main/resources/application-dev.properties target/backend-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

____

## Docker cleanup

stop all containers:
docker kill $(docker ps -q)

remove all containers
docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)

remove all docker images
docker rmi $(docker images -q)

## Azure set up

### Backend
- Uses Azure web app service.
- Backend is reachable on the url you provide during web app service initial set up. (https://iti0203-team04-back.azurewebsites.net/ for our project) 
#### Docker 
- Single container mode.
- Docker image is downloaded from Azure image registry.
- Pipeline is set up to build a docker image and deploy it to image registry.
#### Networking
- Backend is served using Apache Tomcat.
- Tomcat listens on port 8098 but it is forwarded using docker.
- Backend is accessable on port 80 using both http and https protocols.
    - Docker compose sets the image to use different port but it is forwarded to use 80 by Azure.
- Port 9001 is used for management (Actuator)
#### Logs
- Logs are accessable on https://iti0203-team04-back.scm.azurewebsites.net/api/vfs/LogFiles/ or replace iti0203-team04 with the name of your web app service.
- New logfiles for each day
- Four log files
    - 2019_11_14_..._easyauth_docker.log logs requests to the backend
    - 2019_11_14_..._default_docker.log logs backend output
- Additionally on Azure you can look at Log stream which is realtime logging of the web app service.

### Database
- Uses Azure postgres database service.
- Database is reachable on the url you provide during web app service initial set up. (greenchatdb.postgres.database.azure.com for our project)
- First time set up requires setting up an empty table named `users` otherwise backend will not function correctly.
- Database contents can be managed using Adminer or other similar tools.
- Database username and password is agonaut@greenchatdb:AgonaudidTeam4


Planned works:none
-------

* [X] Implement admin page and functionality for it in frontend and backend. (username: agonaudid, password: team4)
* [X] Implement JWT security token for authentication when using public endpoints.
* [X] Restructure API.
* [X] Implement removing users, comments and reviews.
* [X] Implement displaying users, comments and reviews.
* [X] Write more unit tests and integration tests. Especially for endpoints.
